# Finite Element Analysis for Simulations Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains assignments and projects for the SOC project on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using Machine Learning (ML). The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to improve and automate simulations in finite element analysis.


Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a computational technique used to approximate solutions to boundary value problems in engineering. Machine Learning (ML) offers promising methods to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of these simulations. This project explores the integration of ML with FEA for various simulations.
